# html-jtoast-notifications
A popup local-notification plugin library, like toast(), that only uses HTML5, CSS3, and javascript

As a minimalist, I abhore large libraries to do simple things. I like the Android [library toast](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts). There is a similar version by *Eddie Ver Bruggen* called [cordova-plugin-x-toast](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-x-toast), and other simple version called [cordova-plugin-simple-toast](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-simple-toast). The big drawbacks for all these solutions (originally and still) include some drawbacks.

- installed as a plugin
- inflexible time parameters
- poor control of asthetics (colors, fonts, style, etc)

Ideally with Phonegap&trade;, a single-object Javascript library should be able to do the job. This is *JToast*.

*JToast* is a single-object Javascript with multiple methods for grainular automatation. The object has three (3) methods so actions can be controlled via [parameterless event listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener). Those methods are `fire()`, `extinguish()`, and `flip()`. The first two (2) (`fire()` & `extinguish()`) can take parameters, but if none are given they follow the pre-assign parameters (or the default parameters, if none are pre-assigned). The third method (`flip()`) makes the *jtoast* appear or disappear. `flip()` is the only method that takes no parameters.

Finer granularity is available with two additional methods (`init()` & `message()`). `init()` lets you use your own *div ID* and set the *timeout parameter*; both parameters are optional.  `message()` lets you set all the parmeters, but does not make *JToast* appear or disappear; use `flip()` for that. All parameters for `message()` are optional.

## <a name=synopsis>Synopsis</a> ##

This library is for local notifications. It uses a `<div>` popup that gets positioned with `postion:absolute`. The notification has only one pane, and therefore only one window for a message. This means no title or subject. Hence, the name *jtoast*.

The notification is initially hidden and not visible. Once `fire()` is called, the notification goes through the process of becoming visible. `extinguish()` is used to make the notification hidden and invisible again.

One important note, the CSS file contains `transition: opacity 4s ease;`. It determines the total time the fade-in and fade-out take. The [transistion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) parameter can be used with a [variety of other parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions). `ease` is the simplest timing parameter.

W3 Schools [describes](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) `ease` as

> specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)

The CSS `transition` parameter is complex, but it can add quite a bit of flair to any message. I will not cover that in this article. There are plenty of articles on the Internet that describe this parameter for animation.

## <a name=usage>Usage</a> ##

Along with this section, see the files simple.html, simple.css, and simple.js.

The simplest way to use *JToast* is to 

1. Add the CSS and Javascript to the HTML page
2. Add a `div` with the `id=jtoast` and the `class=jtoast`. Namely, `<div id=jtoast class=jtoast></div>`
3. Next, add any text you wish in the `div`
4. Call `jtoast.fire()` when the message is needed.

To add your own style, create a CSS class with those style changes and add the class to the `div` &mdash; like this:

    <div id=jtoast class='jtoast myclass'></div>

To create your own custom message, define your CSS class and use a JSON with `fire()`

```
    jtoast.fire({
        'id':'alert',
        'timeout':8000,
        'message':'This is another messge. <img src=dialog-error.png><br><br>This works the with <u>HTML</u> <b>inside</b> it.',
        'class':'custom',
        });
```

To be clear on how to use this library, exactly four (4) things are needed. 

1. The *jtoast* CSS class.
2. The *jtoast.js* Javascript file.
3. A *jtoast* `div` entry in the HTML file; like this: `<div id=jtoast class=jtoast>Your message</div>`
4. A call to a *jtoast* method, such as: `jtoast.fire();`

On the later two (2) things, for `3.` the id can change and 'Your message' can change. For `4.`, a variety of methods can be employed. Read the `README.md` with the source code for details.

## <a name=method>Methods</a> ##

There are five (5) methods for this library. If you need it quick, just use `fire()` or `extinguish()`. For more grainular control, there is `init()` and `message()`.

The notification can be customized via `init()` and `message()`. The purpose of `fire()` is to make a notification visible, and with `extinguish()` the notification becomes hidden. You should not have to use `flip()`.

method         |  purpose
---------------|-----------
`init()`       | set the `id` and `timeout` to the notifications 
`message()`    | set the text and *class* to the message
`fire()`       | launch the message &ndash; making it visible
`extinguish()` | manually halt the message &ndash; making it hidden
`flip()`       | actually make the notifications visible and hidden

## Simple Example using <a name=toast>toast.fire()</a> ###

**HTML**

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="jtoast.css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="jtoast.js"></script>
    ::
    <div id=jtoast class=jtoast></div>

**code**

    jtoast.fire({'message':'I am toast.'});

**explanation**

Calls `jtoast.fire()` with a *message*. It will "fade out" after the default `timeout` (7 seconds). Use `jtoast.init()` to change the `timeout`.
